title: Shutting Down

<br>

I first created this site when all my games moved online. The transition was hard,
but also opened up new opportunities via Discord bots. I wanted a way to grab
spells and items. Rather than putting them into the bot, I thought an API of 5e
OGL content would be cool and open up other opportunities.

<br>

I haven't done what I wanted to with this site. I wanted to write blog posts about
DMing, TTRPGs, and share content. It's sat for a while with no real updates. Now
with the uncertainty of the OGL, I'm not sure about what value this site is adding.
In all likelyhood, the changes in the OGL 1.2 won't effect this site, but WotC/Hasbro
has destroyed my trust. Rather than dealing with updating to OGL 1.2, I will be
removing this site on __March 31st, 2023__.

<br>

This will also include my Discord bot [Dwight](https://github.com/mloberg/dwight-discord-bot)
as a lot of content comes from this site and other OGL content. If you want to
have a copy of either of these, download them from [GitHub](https://github.com/mloberg/tome-of-everlasting-dungeons)
before I delete them.

<br>

Remember WotC doesn't own TTRPGs. There's lots of other systems out there. And if
your group wants to keep playing D&D, it doesn't matter as long as you're having
fun. Keep on gaming.
