description: >-
  You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a
  30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each
  creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
  a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by
  this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

  The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone
  else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
