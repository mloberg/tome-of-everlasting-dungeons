description: >-
  You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a
  30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is
  holding and become frightened for the duration.

  While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move
  away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there
  is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it
  doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving
  throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
