description: >-
  You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that
  can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell
  ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

  Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as
  an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's
  knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary
  to the deity's interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer
  instead.

  If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest,
  there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that
  you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.
