description: >-
  You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another
  tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least
  the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You
  instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500
  feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one
  of those trees or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of your
  choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of
  movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree
  you entered.

  You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You
  must end each turn outside a tree.
