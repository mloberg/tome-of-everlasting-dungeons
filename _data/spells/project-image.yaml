description: >-
  You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy
  can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardles
   of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is
   intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell
   ends.

  You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make
  it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your
  mannerisms perfectly.

  You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its
  space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to
  using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded
  and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
  things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the
  image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
  (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the
  illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise
  it makes sounds hollow to the creature.
