  As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet
  of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a
  15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire
  damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

  The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or
  carried.

  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
  higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
