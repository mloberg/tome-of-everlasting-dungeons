description: >-
  You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an
  area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends,
  an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the
  warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that wonâ€™t
  set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

  A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of
  the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

  An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60
  feet.
