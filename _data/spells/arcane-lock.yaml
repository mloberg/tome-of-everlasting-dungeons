description: >-
  You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it
  becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you
  cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password
  that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1
  minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is
  dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock
  for 10 minutes.

  While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force
  open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
