description: >-
  Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting
  from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in
  the area into difficult terrain.

  A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength
  saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A
  creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check
  against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

  When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
