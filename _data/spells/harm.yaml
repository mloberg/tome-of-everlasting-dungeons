description: >-
  You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range.
  The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes
  14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage
  can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving
  throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the
  necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's
  hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.
