description: >-
  You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you
  can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of
  hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.

  Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large
  or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot
  cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with
  metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can
  be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality
  of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw
  materials.

  Creatures or magic items can't be created or transmuted by this spell. You
  also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of
  craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have
  proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to craft such objects.
