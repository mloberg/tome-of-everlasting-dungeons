description: >-
  You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in
  a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make
  a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it
  wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two
  effects.

  You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When
  this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has
  not expired in the meantime.

  Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your
  choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is
  attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being
  harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the
  GM rules otherwise.
