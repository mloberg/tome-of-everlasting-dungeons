spell: Giant Insect
level: 4
school: transmutation
class:
  - Druid
time: 1 action
range: 30 feet
components: V, S
duration: 10 minutes
ritual: false
concentration: true
description: >-
  You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion
  within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A
  centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp
  becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.

  Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn
  each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their
  actions and movement.

  A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit
  points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

  The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you
  transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a giant
  wasp.
