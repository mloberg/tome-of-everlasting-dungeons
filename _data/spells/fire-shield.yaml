  Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright
  light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end
  the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

  The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose.
  The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield
  grants you resistance to fire damage.

  In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee
  attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from
  a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.
