  You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for
  the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their
  intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby
  locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived
  within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small
  favor for you, at the GM's discretion.
