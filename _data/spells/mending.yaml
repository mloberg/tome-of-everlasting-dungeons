description: >-
  This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a
  broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking
  wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any
  dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

  This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell
  can't restore magic to such an object.
