  A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied
  space of your choice that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that
  space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with
  the symbol of your deity.

  Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the
  guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving
  throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much
  damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of
  60 damage.
