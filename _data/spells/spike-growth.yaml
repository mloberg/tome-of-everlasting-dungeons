description: >-
  The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and
  sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the
  duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing
  damage for every 5 feet it travels.

  The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature
  that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom
  (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as
  hazardous before entering it.
