description: >-
  You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within
  range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving
  throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much
  damage on a successful one.

  A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a
  zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to
  the best of its ability.
