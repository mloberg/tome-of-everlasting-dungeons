description: >-
  You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of
  15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form
  appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

  When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can
  see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved in the
  area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or
  starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
  the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8
  necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes
  half as much damage.

  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
  higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
