description: >-
  A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high
  cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light
  fills the cylinder.

  When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts
  its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and
  it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a
  failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

  A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also
  instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until
  it leaves the spell's light.

  On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move
  the beam 60 feet in any direction.

  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
  higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
