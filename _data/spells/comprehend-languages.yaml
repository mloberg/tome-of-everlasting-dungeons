description: >-
  For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language
  that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you
  must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1
  minute to read one page of text.

  This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an
  arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.
