description: >-
  You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
  phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot
  that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely
  real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing
  depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound
  loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might
  sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).

  As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to
  cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes
  location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural
  for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it,
  you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can
  cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it
  carry on a conversation, for example.

  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
  things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the
  image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
  (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the
  illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other
  sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
  higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.
