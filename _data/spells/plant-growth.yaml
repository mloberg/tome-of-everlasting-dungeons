description: >-
  This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two
  possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.

  If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal
  plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown.
  A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1
  foot it moves.

  You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from
  being affected.

  If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a
  half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year.
  The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
