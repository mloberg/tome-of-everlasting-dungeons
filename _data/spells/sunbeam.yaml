description: >-
  A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide,
  60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving
  throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded
  until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and
  isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this
  saving throw.

  You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the
  spell ends.

  For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds
  bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This
  light is sunlight.
