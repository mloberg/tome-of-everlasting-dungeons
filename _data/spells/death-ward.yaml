description: >-
  You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.

  The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking
  damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends.

  If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that
  would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead
  negated against the target, and the spell ends.
