description: >-
  You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message.
  The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper
  that only you can hear.

  You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the
  target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1
  inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the
  spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely
  around corners or through openings.
