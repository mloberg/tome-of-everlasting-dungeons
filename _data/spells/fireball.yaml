description: >-
  A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within
  range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each
  creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a
  Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
  half as much damage on a successful one.

  The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that
  aren't being worn or carried.

  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
  higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
