description: >-
  You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport
  to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with
  you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you
  prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first
  preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.

  You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such
  as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to
  cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn't dedicated to your deity,
  the spell has no effect.
