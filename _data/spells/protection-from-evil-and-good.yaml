description: >-
  Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against
  certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends,
  and undead.

  The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have
  disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be
  charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed,
  frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any
  new saving throw against the relevant effect.
