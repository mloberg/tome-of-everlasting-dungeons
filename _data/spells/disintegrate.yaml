description: >-
  A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can
  see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of
  magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.

  A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
  failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces
  the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

  A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except
  magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be
  restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

  This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or
  a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or
  creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A
  magic item is unaffected by this spell.

  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
  higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
