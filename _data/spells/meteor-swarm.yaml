description: >-
  Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can
  see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each
  point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around
  corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a
  failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the
  area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

  The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
  aren't being worn or carried.
