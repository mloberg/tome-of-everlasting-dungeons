description: >-
  You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range.
  The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts
  for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10
  miles per hour) disperses it.

  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
  higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above
  1st.
