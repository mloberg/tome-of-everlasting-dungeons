description: >-
  Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose
  within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving
  throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded
  for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't
  blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving
  throw.

  A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at
  the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

  This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
