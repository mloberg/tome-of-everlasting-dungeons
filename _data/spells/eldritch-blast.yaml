description: >-
  A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a
  ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force
  damage.

  The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams
  at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can
  direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate
  attack roll for each beam.
