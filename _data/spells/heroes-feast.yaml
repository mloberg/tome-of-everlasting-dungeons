description: >-
  You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink. The feast
  takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the
  beneficial effects don't set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve other
  creatures can partake of the feast.

  A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is
  cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being
  frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point
  maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points.
  These benefits last for 24 hours.
